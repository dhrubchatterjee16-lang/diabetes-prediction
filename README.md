This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on specific diagnostic measurements. Using a classification-based approach, the model identifies patterns in health data to assist in early detection.📌 Project OverviewDiabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. Early prediction can help in taking preventive measures. This project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to build a predictive model that classifies whether a patient has diabetes.📊 Dataset DescriptionThe dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome).Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).BMI: Body mass index (weight in $kg/(height in m)^2$).DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Genetic score for diabetes.Age: Age in years.Outcome: Class variable (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes).🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, SeabornEnvironment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab🚀 Key FeaturesData Cleaning: Handling missing values (zeros in glucose/BP often represent missing data).Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to understand feature importance.Feature Scaling: Standardizing data for better performance in algorithms like KNN and SVM.Model Comparison: Comparison between Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).📈 Results & EvaluationSince this is a medical application, we prioritize Recall (minimizing False Negatives) over simple Accuracy.
